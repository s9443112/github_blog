# Fucking abroad life



I feel boring and lonely in Melbourne.

Because there was no one have ever invited me to anywhere.

I was trying to make a relationship with everybody.

When everyone faced to me ,they all with a smile on their face.

But actually, everyone was in indifferent .

They hung out together by them self.

No people invite or ask me if I want to join with them.

I felt very very very sad.

Everyday when after class, I always go back home by myself.

I tried to talk with them,and tried to ask if I can join with them. Sometimes , I made and organize a plan and asked if they want to join with me .Go hanging out together can more have fun.

However, they used any kinds of excuses and refused me.

Always said that maybe we can hang out together next time.

I always said to my heart.

" Don't worry ,maybe next time I can success,

Sun Yat-sen had revolution ten times and then he success.

Now, I have been many time more than him

I will overcome the fate of the failure! "

<br/>


But,the fact is always cruel.

I did a lot of strives,but just only left regret on me.

I always thought about if I had done something wrong or I was rude to them when I failed.

Now, I have been in Melbourne several months, I feel tired now.

I can't stand it anymore.

<br/>

My family are all bullshit. My eldest sister and second sister both are even bitches.

They always think about them self and very selfish.

When I need a help, they never give me a hand.

Even said I was a foolish.Used a lot of bad and tart language behind me.

What a fucking sibling!
