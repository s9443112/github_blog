# Doubting the life in AUS

I have already been working for a month, everything has been on track.
It's about time to forget the miss of melbourne and my friends, though I feel upset with my life in Australia. There's some thing I can't understand. Before I saw Fabio who is still in contact with Miho, who was my classmates before. And they had fun with sharing their life. I used to think maybe if one day when I came back to Taiwan. I can still contact with someone and connect our relationship. However, I am passionate about myself. 

Why did I say that? Because there's no one will contact with me actively, Every time I take the initiative to contact others. Hang on, when you looked at last sentence, maybe you will think, "That's fine! It's still keep connection, why you felt upset? ". This is a point that I want to explian. If the friend relationship is based on a single convenient communication, do you think that's good? Yes, absolutely it's rubbish! 

I was feel exhausted to do that, I give up. And when I stopped contacting anyone by actively, Communication that we also stop. I doubt the friendship which is weak. 

Now I'm thinking what things did I learn from went abroad for 7 months? Learning English? Making friends? Relaxing the holiday? No... everthing was gone when I came back to Taiwan...

I feel sorry to my parents, who gave me the last chance to Australia for learning and relaxing. They said English was not the most important. The most important thing is making the foreign friends and broaden my horizons and visions. But... what did I do? Hang out by myself or being bullied by others in the classroom? Umm.... I don't know what I did wrong.
