# 國小同學會

It's a long time I had never met with my elementary school classmates.
When we met each other, it was very exciting to see them.
We talked a lot about our old memory during studying, and talked each other recent life.
When we talked , I can't help but I looked myslef.
I think I'm really decadant. I always wasting my time and life.
I need to wake up.
