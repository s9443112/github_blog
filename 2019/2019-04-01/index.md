# No end, where is the beginning?

  I had been staying in Australia for just seven months, when I returned to Taiwan, it’s really an unreal feeling. I feel that there is one less in my heart, I don’t know if it’s happy or sad.But I know that I am satisfied.

  Although I followed my second sister to Australia, actually I was alone here.
I am very happy to meet my friends all, and I am very grateful to everyone for being friends with me. Whatever if you are unhappy of me in your heart, I sincerely thank you guys.

  The old classmates left and the new classmates arrived.
It is about time for me to leave, although I really want to stay in Australia.

  But my life is not just staying here, I have to move on. I must to finish the journey for this trip. Maybe it is not a perfect end, but a good ending.

  Think of a sentence in Japanese.
  花は桜木, 人は武士
  Like the current life as the cherry blossoms are brilliant, the end should also decisively leave.

  My dear friends and comrades,
I respect you a glass of beer, let us share the cheers!

待在澳洲短短的七個月，當我回到台灣有種不真實的感覺。
感覺心裡少了一塊，不知是喜還是悲。
但我知道，我心滿意足了。

雖然我是跟著我二姐來到澳洲，但基本上我在這邊都是一個人單打獨鬥。
我很高興認識你們大家，同時也很感謝大家能夠和我做朋友。
無論你們心裡是否有對我疙瘩，但是我由衷的感謝你們。

舊的同學離去，新的同學到來。
如今也到我離去的時刻，雖然我很想繼續待在澳洲。

但我的人生不是只有停留在這，我必須前進下去。我必須為這趟旅程劃下句點，也許這不是個完美結束，但是一個好結局。

想到日語的一句話
花は桜木、人は武士
把握當下生活如同櫻花燦爛，結束也該果斷離去

親愛的朋友及同志們
我敬你們一杯酒，讓我們共襄盛舉
