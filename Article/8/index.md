# Weekend life part 2

I went to the NGV last Friday, though I have been there twice. But this time was different, I invited mu friend, whose name is First, and hung out together. I was surprised that he has been Melbourne for 2 months, buthe had never been there before. I asked him why not visit the NGV? You are in Melbourne now, you need to go out and explore something beautiful, make your life more colorful. He said because he is shy and restrained, he can't do anything by himself. Absolutely, this is a big lie. I don't believe hom at all. The reason is, beause I always see his story of night club life on Instrgram every week. He looks so crazy, anyway. We had a good holiday this week.
