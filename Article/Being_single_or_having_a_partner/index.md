# Being single or having a partner

Do you prefer being single or having a partner? What kinds do you like? I hope I have a partner one day. If I have a partner, I won't be lonely in homestay. In addition, I can talk to my partner something funny or exciting anout today. And we can go traveling together. How exciting! However, sometimes I prefer being single. Why? Because I want to be on my own sometimes. But my partner wants to play with me. It's feel like being trapped! I don't like it. I want to have freedom. I think it's important to life. Therefore my mind is calm. However being single or having a partner has advantages and disadvantages. Both are good for us. So don't worry too much, just enjoy it!
