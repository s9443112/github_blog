# Scary things

Today, I'm talking about the worst day of my life. When I remembered it, I was very scared and creepy every time. It was a real gossip story that I won't forget it.

During college, there hadn't classed all day, so our students often liked to ride a scooter for relaxing after class. Some students liked to hang out together, other people liked to ride it by themselves, and I'm the second one. One day, it was a beautiful and sunny afternoon. I rode my "Little girlfriend" to a mountain, which is the tallest mountain in Taiwan. Maybe I had been riding for 4 hours. However, when I arrived to the top of the mountain, the sky became cloudy and dark. I didn't care about that. Then, I felt tired. There was a summer house, where I took a nap. In addition, I didn't know how long I had slept. I just knew when I woke up, it was already midnight. It were a few lights there. I felt a little scared, as a result, I hurried up to wear a helmet and rode the scooter to go back my home. When I was riding, I felt someone sit behind me. At that moment, I stopped my scooter and wore earphones to try to change my mind.ã€€Unfortunely, I got lost, so I used the GPS to guide me in the right path, but it took me to the path pf death! If I still followed the GPS, I will fall down of the mountain and die! However, it was not finished, I remembered the last sound from GPS ,which said. "It's shame, jajajajajaja..." How horrible it is!

In the end, I called the police to help me. I really cannot forget this horrible memory. In that week, I got a terrible dream every night. Until I went to a temple and prayed my god to pretect me, Now I learned a new lesson. Do not go anywhere ny yourself in night!
