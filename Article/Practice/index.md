Let's talk about my friends whose name is Kirito. He is one of my best friends. His personality is very "Chunni". This word means someone who os like a child, always doing childish and crazy behavior. For example, my friend, sometimes he hold touble blades in both hands, and then shouts "STAR BURST STREAM"! and waves the blades fastly. Though his behavior is like a fool, he is very smart, like a genius. He can get high points in a test without study hard. And he has a beautiful girlfriend. Sometimes I really envy and jealous of him.
