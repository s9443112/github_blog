# The best holiday

My best holiday was in Hawaii, which is a island belonging
to the United States. I went to there 4 years ago. At that time, I had just finished my senior graduation exam, and then, I had a beautiful vacation in Honolulu which is the capital city of Hawaii.

There's a beautiful and deep blue sky. The sea was also clear blue. And there are lots of women, who weared Bikinis, lying on the pale white beach. 

I went to many places, Waikiki beach, Pearl Harbor and the Brigham Young university. Each place has its own characteristies and property. However their shop items are so expensive because a small island which relies on imports. But it's not a big problem, which won't cover its advantages. If I have a chance for another holiday, I'll go there again.
