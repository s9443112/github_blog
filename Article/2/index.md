# Weekend life

I stayed at home ad watched a movie on Saturday. The movie name is "Game of Throne", which talks about a dynastic war among serveral families for control of Westeros. Though I have watched it 3 times, I still review it again. Besides, I borrowed books from library and tried to read it. Yes, indeed. I really not understand what books talking about. It's too much vocabulary I can't understand, and there's too much difficult sentences to me. Despite everything are diffcult to me, I never give up to read it.
