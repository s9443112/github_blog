# The person who is important in my life

Good morning everybody.My name is Timothy.Today I’m going to talk about the person who is important in my life.

This is my family portrait. I think all members in my family are important in my life. But there’s no enough time to talk about all. So ,Today I just talk about Master of the house.Yes, indeed ,it’s my father.

My father is sometimes humor, often telling some jokes that are not really funny, but sometimes it is serious and no smile all the day. Although He always tell me about his philosophy of life, most I hardly understand.I was really Embarrassed by the other way, I don’t want to hear my father’s murmur . Until now, I’m still think he is difficult.

However, I must say, my father is really powerful, Let our children of my family grow up comfortably and safely, and Can also send us to study abroad.
During my grow up, he gave me a lot of help ,These things I have today are all given to me by my father ,Without my father, I am nothing.At the same time, I also admire my father. He has a sentence that impressed me a lot.

將相本無種 男兒當自強

In english mean Man is not born to greatness, he achieves it by his own efforts. Even your dad is professor or admiral, they won’t give you the talent, everything you have to work hard by yourself.

Finally, I’m so love my dad without murmur~ That’s it thank you everybody
