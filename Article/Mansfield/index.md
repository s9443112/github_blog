Before I came to Australia, I searched information about scenery here. There were lots of places which have a beautiful view or a special history and culture. Until now, I have been to several places. like the Great Ocean Road, MCG, NGV, Victoria market, etc. All of them are amazing and wonderful.

In my opinion, I prefer the countryside to the city. There's a special place, called Masfield, which has wide farms and wild life. When I was driving, I saw lots of wild animals beside the road. For example, dingoes ,kangarzooes and deer, and I also saw a rare animal. It's a platypus! How amazing! After driving, I slept in a caravan with my friends, andalso lighted a fire and had a drink in the night time. However , I think it's a little dangerous in the wild because of forest fires. We must be careful. 

In the end, whatever place you like, we have to keep staying safe all the time. Anyway, enjoy your life and don't be shy. Open with your mind and find other foreigners to hang out together. Hope we all have a wonderful and colorful memory in Australia.
