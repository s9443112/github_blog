# Technology

People have get more and more dependents on technology in recents years.

Yes, indeed. I think this is a inevitable result though it's not a good development. This is the world current trend.

From the very beginning. I used to use a dictionary book to search the word. Now, I use a dictionary APP on the smart phone. Before we used to search the road on the complex and unclear map. Now, we use Google Map, it's more simple and convenient.

In this technologically advanced society, mobile phone has become an indispensable part of our lifes.
